# fedora-setup

My personal setup script for Fedora

Only use this, if you understand what it does, because it will remove, install applications and configure Fedora to my needs.

Things you should remove or change:
- Git Configuration
- Install Printer and Scanner Drivers (MFC-9142CDN)
- Add crontab
