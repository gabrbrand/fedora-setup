# fedora-setup

My personal setup script for Fedora

Only use this, if you understand what it does, because it will remove, install and configure Fedora to my needs.

Things you might want to remove or change:
- Git Configuration
- Install Anki
- Install BlueJ (flatpak)
- Install and run Tutanota (AppImage)
- Install Printer and Scanner Drivers (MFC-9142CDN)
